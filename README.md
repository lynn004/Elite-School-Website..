# Elite School Website ðŸŒŸ

## About this project
Hi! ðŸ‘‹ This is my first attempt at building a simple school website using HTML and CSS.  
The goal was to practice **structuring a webpage** and applying **responsive styling** using an external CSS file.

## Files Submitted
- **index.html**: My HTML5 structure with headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, media, and a sample form.  
- **style.css**: My responsive CSS file using **Flexbox**, **Grid**, and **media queries** to make the website look good on different screen sizes.

## What the code demonstrates
- Clear use of **Flexbox** and **Grid** for layout.  
- Responsiveness with **proper breakpoints** for mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- Clean and maintainable CSS structure, with **helpful comments** explaining how things work.
